# Causal Inference I

## Topics

* Introduction to Causal Inference.
* Finishing up "stop rates" description.
* Implementing the Veil of Darkness.

## Reading and Analyses
  
* Read [Mostly Harmless
  Econometrics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51992844_Mostly_Harmless_Econometrics_An_Empiricist's_Companion/link/00b4953344a9a0cb13000000/download)
  (sections 2.1, 2.2, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2). While reading the book,
  carefully understand how it relates to the
  [notebook](material/Simulation.ipynb) from section last week.
  
* Recreate the analyses in the Simulation notebook on the SD stops
  data using the naive approximation for stops rates we have been
  using (you have already computed the necessary tables in previous
  work!). How do you think the data generating process for the SD data
  compares to the data generating processes defined in the notebook? 

* Recreate the Veil of Darkness study on SD data. You may find the
  OpenPolicing tutorial useful. Note, this study doesn't use
  stop-rate, but a different measurement! (When doing this, flexibly
  structure your code; you will be expected to compute these results
  across years/places for assignment-2).

## Discussion questions from reading and analysis

* TBD
