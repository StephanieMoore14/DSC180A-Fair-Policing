# Background: Police, Traffic, and Discrimination

## Topics
* Measures of inequality: False Positives in context
* Particulars of traffic stops; impacts of traffic stops; the roads in the USA
* History of Policing in the USA: the start of predictive policing

## Reading and Analyses

* [Suspect Citizens: What 20 Million Traffic Stops Tell Us About Policing and Race](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNP1QS6/) by [Frank R. Baumgartner](https://fbaum.unc.edu/), Derek A. Epp, Kelsey Shoub

* Download [San Diego traffic stops data](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-vehicle-stops/) and familiarize yourself with the fields in the data (perform a cursory EDA).

* Skim [Traffic Enforcement in San Diego  Report](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/sdpdvehiclestopsfinal.pdf) and use chapters 1/2 to contrast North Carolina and San Diego.

## Discussion questions from the reading/data

* What is the role of police in a democracy? What relationship do they
  have with citizens of the location? Be sure to consider the role
  that both law-creation and law-enforcement play in such a society.
* What are the possible purposes of traffic stops? Reconcile these
  purposes in the San Diego police data (e.g. using the `stop_cause`
  field), when possible.
* Summarize the impacts of the court cases Terry and Whren on policing
  in the United States. 
* List some ways to identify stops based on ‘pretext’ versus ‘road
  safety’ in the data.
* Look up the difference in racial composition by state using the
  [census
  website](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219). Think
  about how the demographics of the driving population might be
  different than the overall demographics of each state. Given the
  results of the North Carolina study, what differences in results
  would you expect to find in a similar analysis of San Diego?
* Suppose you train two "predictive policing" classifiers that
  predict: whether a stopped driver will be arrested, and whether a
  searched driver possessed contraband. Carefully think through the
  meaning of false positives/negatives in each model. What is
  difficult about training a classifier that predicts whether a driver
  will be stopped?
